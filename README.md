📊 Handling Batches in Contingency Tables

This project focuses on analyzing categorical datasets by generating and evaluating contingency tables in batches. It provides an efficient framework to understand the relationship between two or more categorical variables using statistical tests, automated batch processing, and intuitive visualizations. The system is designed to handle large datasets, uncover patterns, and support data-driven decision-making across various domains such as business analytics, social sciences, and public health.

✅ Key Features

Batch Processing: Automatically create and analyze contingency tables for multiple variable combinations.

Statistical Tests: Perform Chi-Square Test, Fisher’s Exact Test, and compute effect size metrics like Cramer's V.

Visualization: Heatmaps and frequency tables for better interpretation of associations.

Scalable & Efficient: Reduces manual work by automating repetitive statistical analysis tasks.

Beginner-Friendly Implementation: Simple, readable code suitable for students and researchers.
